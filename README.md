# sawarineko: plurality made easier (for us)

Project Sawarineko is a web1.0 page generator / "people information" protocol (of sorts) written in bash, using imagemagick. 
Its main use case is for plural systems that require a method to document their members.
Designed to be easily pages'd, running `intro-all.sh` will generate all members' intros and create `index.html` to introduce all members.
